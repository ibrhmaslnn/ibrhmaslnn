Hi, Iâ€™m Ibrahim Aslan. I work in Turk Telekom as an assistant engineer at the Fixed Networks Inovasion and Test Center department in Turkey.
I am interested in data science and web frameworks.

Here is the early release of my website which uses artificial neural network algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabet.
The model has %99.58 accuracy.
Flask is used for deployment.

It is the raw version of the project. Required developments will be performed following days. After completing developments source codes of the project will be imported on my github repo.
